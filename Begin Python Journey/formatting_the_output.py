#    1) minimize the number of print() function invocations by inserting the \n sequence into the strings
#    2) make the arrow twice as large (but keep the proportions)
#    3) duplicate the arrow, placing both arrows side by side; note: a string may be multiplied by using the following trick: "string" * 2 will produce "stringstring" (we'll tell you more about it soon)
#    5) remove any of the quotes, and look carefully at Python's response; pay attention to where Python sees an error - is this the place where the error really exists?
#    6) do the same with some of the parentheses;
#    7) change any of the print words into something else, differing only in case (e.g., Print) - what happens now?
#    8) replace some of the quotes with apostrophes; watch what happens carefully.

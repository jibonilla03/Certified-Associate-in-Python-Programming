# LAB   The continue statement – the Pretty Vowel Eater
## Scenario

Your task here is even more special than before: you must redesign the (ugly) vowel eater from the previous lab and create a better, upgraded (pretty) vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

    a for loop;
    the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
    the continue statement.

Your program must:

    ask the user to enter a word;
    use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon - don't worry;
    use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
    assign the uneaten letters to the word_without_vowels variable and print the variable to the screen.

Look at the code in the editor. We've created word_without_vowels and assigned an empty string to it. Use concatenation operation to ask Python to combine selected letters into a longer string during subsequent loop turns, and assign it to the word_without_vowels variable.

Test your program with the data we've provided for you.

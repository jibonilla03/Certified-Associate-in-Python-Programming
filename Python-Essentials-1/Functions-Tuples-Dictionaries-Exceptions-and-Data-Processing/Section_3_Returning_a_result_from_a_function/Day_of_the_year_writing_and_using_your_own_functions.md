# LAB   Day of the year: writing and using your own functions

Your task is to write and test a function which takes three arguments (a year, a month, and a day of the month) and returns the corresponding day of the year, or returns None if any of the arguments is invalid.

Use the previously written and tested functions. Add your own test cases to the code.
